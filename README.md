# PPM Dashboard

The following Power BI dashboards analyze PPM data collected over the course of three years. This project was developed during a Supply Chain internship to identify recurring defects, determine their root causes, and analyze the affected products. The dashboards were used to inform quality improvement efforts and recommend corrective actions.

*The original data has been altered to protect company privacy. All names and personal identifiers have been anonymized and replaced with generic values.*

*Over 40 customer accounts, 70 products, and 100 failure modes were part of this analysis, but for visibility within the data models, only the most prevalent items are highlighted in the dashboards.*

## Scope

- Frequency of claims
- Affected records and models
- Defect responsibility
- Problematic manufacturing years
- Failure modes
